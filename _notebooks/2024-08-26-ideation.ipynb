    "# Ocean-Themed Interactive Web Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for an ocean-themed web project emerged from my love for the ocean. I love going to the beach and swimming, I enjoy going to aquariums and watching marine life. I want to give an aquatic feel to my site. Future plans include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Waves**: Simulating water movement to create a more dynamic background.\n",
    "- **Seaweed**: Adding swaying plants to enhance the sense of being underwater.\n",
    "- **More Sea Life**: Introducing additional creatures like jellyfish and dolphins to enrich the environment.\n",
    "- **Submarine**: Make the site experience feel more like the user is underwater in a submarine.\n",

    "## Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floating Text Animation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: The floating text, such as \"Blub Blub,\" did not always align correctly with the fish's mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Adjusted the text's position using `getBoundingClientRect()` to ensure it appears accurately over the fish's mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Animation Synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: The animations for floating text and fish movements were occasionally out of sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Fine-tuned the animation timings and ensured that all related CSS properties were correctly applied, resulting in smoother transitions and better synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools Error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: Encountered errors while using `nbconvert` to convert Jupyter notebooks to HTML, which broke my makefile. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Investigated the error messages and updated `nbconvert` and its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SASS Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: Incorrect SASS syntax led to some styles not being applied correctly and broke my styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Ensured all class names and properties were accurately defined.\n",
