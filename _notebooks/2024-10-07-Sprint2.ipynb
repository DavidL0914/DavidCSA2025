    "## Key Highlights From Each Unit \n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 2:\n",
    "Developed a strong understanding of how to model real-world entities through classes and objects.\n",
    "Learned the importance of encapsulation in keeping data secure and methods organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 3:\n",
    "Gained insights into using boolean values to manage conditions and control program flow.\n",
    "Applied boolean logic to check states, such as availability of books in the library system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 4:\n",
    "Mastered the use of loops for repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency in processing collections.\n",
    "Implemented iteration techniques to navigate through lists of books and users in the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 5:\n",
    "Explored the concept of classes as blueprints for creating objects, focusing on attributes and methods.\n",
    "Created custom classes, which improved code organization and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 6:\n",
    "Learned to manage fixed-size collections of data with arrays, understanding their advantages and limitations.\n",
    "Enhanced data handling skills by using arrays to store and manipulate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 7:\n",
    "Discovered the dynamic nature of ArrayLists, which allow for easy addition and removal of elements.\n",
    "Improved program flexibility by leveraging ArrayLists to manage library books and users efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 8:\n",
    "Although not directly used in the project, explored the concept of 2D arrays for managing more complex data structures.\n",
    "Recognized potential applications of 2D arrays in future projects, such as tracking multiple copies of books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit 9:\n",
    "Gained a foundational understanding of inheritance, allowing for code reuse and hierarchy in classes.\n",
    "Identified opportunities for extending the library system through inheritance to accommodate various user types."
