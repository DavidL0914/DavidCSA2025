## Grading Overview

All self and peer grading must be completed prior to Teacher review date(s). Ensure there is a direct link to the tangible(s) for each line item.

### Sprint 1 Key Objectives

During the sprint, you need to complete all key objectives and find supporting hacks that demonstrate the level of command you are declaring.

### Rank to Ratio (Rank is an integer)
- 0 = .00: Work completed, but faking understanding/accomplishment
- 1 = .55: Incomplete assignment, big gaps
- 2 = .75: Meeting some objectives, multiple little gaps
- 3 = .85: Meeting most objectives, one little gap
- 4 = .90: Meeting all objectives
- 4+ Mastered-Y = .95: Exceeding all objectives, requires links and office hour verification
