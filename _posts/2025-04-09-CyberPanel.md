# Cybersecurity Notes

## Main Ideas
- Phishing & Zero-Day Attacks  
  - Zero-Day: Exploits with no patch available  
  - Example: If Microsoft didn't verify cloud update senders, attackers could push malware updates to every device  

- Ethical Hackers  
  - Hack systems to find vulnerabilities  
  - Sometimes create backdoors (bad practice)  

- Cybersecurity is Learnable  
  - Anyone can learn cyber if curious & persistent  
  - Looks difficult but very worth it  

- Pathway Into Cybersecurity  
  - Start with IT fundamentals  
  - People skills are essential: leadership, reputation, reliability  
  - Build your own network (understand how it works & hack it)  
  - Join hackathons, find mentors, seek internships  

- People-Centric Nature of Cyber  
  - Security is not just technical — it's human  
  - Adversarial environments may force tough decisions  
  - Working with people is what makes cyber rewarding  

- Global Threat Landscape  
  - Major threats from China & Russia  
  - US government is focusing on defending against them  

- Future of Cybersecurity  
  - In 5-10 years: Cyber will be a top priority for every major company  
  - Many developers don't know secure coding — big skill gap  

- Cyber Certifications  
  - CC Certification recommended  
  - Low-cost way to learn and expose yourself to cyber without pressure  

- Teamwork in Cyber  
  - Working in groups is essential  
  - Learn to manage difficult people, even bad bosses

## Main Takeaways I Got
- Cyber is not locked behind talent — it's open to curiosity & persistence  
- People skills might matter more than technical skills long-term  
- Security is both technical and human — it's about managing risk with people  
- The world is trending toward cybersecurity becoming a necessity everywhere  
- There are accessible ways to start (certifications, IT skills, networking, hackathons)

## Application to CSA (CS Class at School)
- Be more intentional about writing secure code (avoid leaving vulnerabilities)  
- Develop habit of thinking like an attacker — test my code for weak points  
- Focus on group project management — develop leadership and people skills  
- Be proactive in building mini-networks (server projects, backend systems, etc.) to learn  

---

## Application to Real Life (Internships, Jobs, Career)
- Start looking into IT fundamentals as a base for future cybersecurity roles  
- Take CC or other beginner-friendly certifications to get early exposure  
- Network — build connections early, find mentors  
- Apply cybersecurity mindset in all technical work: securing code, thinking adversarially  
- Be aware of global trends — understand the importance of defending systems against nation-state threats  
- Be ready to work in teams — develop patience & management skills for difficult situations

## Impact on My View of Cyber / Future Goals
- Cybersecurity feels more accessible and human-centered than I thought  
- Inspired to build both technical and soft skills equally  
- Want to pursue cybersecurity further — maybe blend software development with security  
- See myself focusing on secure coding practices & infrastructure in future roles  
- Interested in contributing to securing vulnerable systems and educating others about security  
- Motivated to join hackathons and look for internship opportunities in cyber
