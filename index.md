# Hello, I'm David Lee!

Welcome to my personal page. I'm a senior at Del Norte High School. Here’s a little bit about me:

## About Me

I’m David Lee, and I’ve always been driven by a curiosity for technology and a desire to connect with others through meaningful conversations and activities. My journey through high school has been a blend of academic challenges and extracurriculars that engage with topics I am interested in. 

## Interests

### Coding

From an early age, I found joy in solving problems and creating new things through code. My coding journey began with local robotics competitions and has evolved into exploring various programming languages and projects. I’m particularly interested in how technology can be used to improve people’s lives and solve real-world problems.

### Volleyball

Volleyball has been a significant part of my life. I've been playing with our school's team since freshman year and am playing on the varsity team this year. Whether it’s spiking a ball or setting up a play, I love the excitement and the team bonding that this sport offers.

### Debate

Debate has been an integral part of my high school experience, helping me develop critical thinking and public speaking skills. Engaging in debates has sharpened my ability to articulate ideas and understand diverse perspectives. It’s not just about arguing; it’s about fostering dialogue and finding common ground.

## Some of my Favorite Activities

- **Speak Your Thoughts**: As a member of this organization, I help others improve their speaking skills through engaging workshops and resources. It’s rewarding to see how effective communication can empower individuals and drive positive change.

- **Boy Scouts of America (BSA)**: My involvement in BSA has been transformative, from leading service projects to growing as a leader. As an Eagle Scout, I’ve learned the value of community service and leadership.

- **Research**: I do medical research at UCSD involving computer science to create new ways to dianogsis and treat brain diseases, particularily Multiple sclerosis. I analyze and train AI models to recognize myelin quantities in the brain while also facilitating image regiostration, drawing ROIs, and prepare our data for publication.

- **Intern**: I work at NSF-funded project ICICLE to make AI more accessible and implement it to the larger society. I developed a training catalog for ICICLE to train others how to use different softwares ICICLE authors and I have written. I also work with supercomputers to research parallel computing with Jupyter notebooks to make them more efficient.




## Future Goals

Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue exploring my passions and making a difference in the world. I aim to pursue a career in technology and communication, combining my interests in coding and debate to create impactful solutions.
